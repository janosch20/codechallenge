# Craft-IT Coding Challenge "Flying Tweets"

_Weekend, Mar 10 to Mar 12 2017_

__Receive €150 for a weekend of programming!__

_All_ the best selected submissions receive the money.

## Scope

The scope is to show basic understanding of API interaction with oAuth flows. This challenge requires you to know how to interact with APIs, from authentication to data retrieval, storage, caching.

The challenge this time is to interact with an oAuth endpoint and do animations!

Minimum Requirement:
* Oauth Login/Flow for Facebook
* Visual Representation of the last Posts (e.g. flying in via CSS3 animations)
* Save the Posts in a local Database.

Bonus:
* Share-Funktion: Generate a unique URL for sharing a Post to other users.
* Comment on Posts locally: After clicking a Post a comment should be possible. Of course you'd have to save IP/UserAgent/...
* List of all stored Posts/Comments


## Rules
The following is a requirement:

* Use this directory as starting point
* When finished, publish your work somewhere on github
* Do it __on your own__ - this is not a group task
* and submit it __not later than March 12, 23:59:59__ and notify thomas@craft-it.co or add tomw1808 to your github/bitbucket!
* When your code is selected as one of the winners, you have to come in and prove it during a code review
* Be (at least) open to a fulltime/parttime position in our team __and take part in an interview__. You receive the bounty no matter if you are really becoming a team-member or not.
* By participating you accept that sending out invitations on submissions is at Craft-IT’s solely discretion. No submissions will be accepted later than Sunday, March 12 2017, 23:59:59 CET!

## Where to start / What to expect?

The challenge takes a seasoned developer around 1-2 hours of work, until a meaningful result is achieved.

You can use any framework/library you feel is suitable, be it backend/frontend you want, as long as it runs inside the vagrant given in this directory.

We are looking into your code the following week/weeks and get back to you as soon as possible. We are all just humans here, so please add any documentation/instruction in a way that we understand it.

## Necessary Software

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
2. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
3. Go to a shell/terminal/Cmd/gitbash and type `vagrant up` inside this directory.

And work with your favorite IDE inside the `./www` directory.

Point your browser to [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) to get the output of ./www.

type `vagrant ssh` to enter your virtual machine.

This diretory is mounted inside the virtual machine in `/vagrant`.

Make sure nothing else is running on port 8080 or edit the Vagrantfile accordingly.
